# Security Policy

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security vulnerability, please do **not** create a public issue. Instead, report it privately by emailing the maintainer at lazydevpro@gmail.com.

We will respond as soon as possible and work with you to resolve the issue promptly.

## Best Practices
- Do not commit secrets, private keys, or sensitive data to the repository.
- Review pull requests for accidental leaks before merging.
- Use environment variables for all credentials and sensitive configuration.
